# Ping
Ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams `(“pings”)` have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of `“pad”` bytes used to fill out the packet.

Ping works with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them explicitly can be enforced by specifying `q -4` or `-6`.

#### Ping of death
*ping of death* is a type of attack that the attacker manipulate the ping command, by changing one or more of the ping header data causing it to take down the target device that the ping was send to, this *due to a bug* in the ping command.

#### ping flooding
*Ping flooding* is another ping attack that cause denial-of-service attack to the victim compute by sending a lot of ping requests to the target computer and the target computer at some point was *unable to handle* all the ping requests that cause the traffic to fails and not to reach to the target system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fping
*fping* is a program like *ping* which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding. *fping* differs from *ping* in that you can specify any number of targets on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping. Instead of sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next target in a *round-robin fashion*.

In the **default mode**, if a target replies, it is noted and removed from the list of targets to check; if a target does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it is designated as unreachable.

# Arping
The arping utility sends ARP and/or ICMP requests to the specified host and displays the replies. The host may  be  specified by its **hostname**, its **IP** address, or its **MAC** address.

One request is sent each second.

When  pinging  an  IP  an  ARP who-has query is sent. When pinging a MAC address a directed broadcast ICMP Echo request is sent.

**Note on timing**
ARP packets are usually replied to (on a LAN) so fast that the OS task scheduler can’t keep up to get exact enough timing. On an idle system the roundtrip times will be pretty much accurate, but with more load the timing gets less exact.

To get more exact timing on a non-idle system, re-nice arping to -15 or so.

    # nice -n -15 arping foobar

This  is  not just an issue with arping, it is with normal ping also (at least it is on my system). But it doesn’t show up as much with ping since arping packets (when pinging IP) doesn’t traverse the IP stack when  received  and  are  therefore replied to faster.

ARPing 2.21, by Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.se>
usage: arping [ -0aAbdDeFpPqrRuUv ] [ -w <sec> ] [ -W <sec> ] [ -S <host/ip> ]
              [ -T <host/ip ] [ -s <MAC> ] [ -t <MAC> ] [ -c <count> ]
              [ -C <count> ] [ -i <interface> ] [ -m <type> ] [ -g <group> ]
              [ -V <vlan> ] [ -Q <priority> ] <host/ip/MAC | -B>

Options:

    -0     Use this option to ping with source IP address 0.0.0.0. Use this
           when you haven't configured your interface yet.  Note that  this
           may  get  the  MAC-ping  unanswered.   This  is  an alias for -S
           0.0.0.0.
    -a     Audiable ping.
    -A     Only count addresses matching  requested  address  (This  *WILL*
           break  most things you do. Only useful if you are arpinging many
           hosts at once. See arping-scan-net.sh for an example).
    -b     Like -0 but source broadcast source  address  (255.255.255.255).
           Note that this may get the arping unanswered since it's not nor-
           mal behavior for a host.
    -B     Use instead of host if you want to address 255.255.255.255.
    -c count
           Only send count requests.
    -C count
           Only wait for this many replies, regardless of -c and -w.
    -d     Find duplicate replies. Exit with 1 if there are answers from
           two different MAC addresses.
    -D     Display answers as exclamation points and missing packets as dots.
    -e     Like -a but beep when there is no reply.
    -F     Don't try to be smart about the interface name.  (even  if  this
           switch is not given, -i overrides smartness)
    -g group
           setgid() to this group instead of the nobody group.
    -h     Displays a help message and exits.
    -i interface
           Use the specified interface.
    -m type
           Type of timestamp to use for incoming packets. Use -vv when
           pinging to list available ones.
    -q     Does not display messages, except error messages.
    -Q pri 802.1p priority to set. Should be used with 802.1Q (-V).
           Defaults to 0.
    -r     Raw output: only the MAC/IP address is displayed for each reply.
    -R     Raw output: Like -r but shows "the other one", can  be  combined
           with -r.
    -s MAC Set source MAC address. You may need to use -p with this.
    -S IP  Like  -b and -0 but with set source address.  Note that this may
           get the arping unanswered if the target does not have routing to
           the  IP.  If you don't own the IP you are using, you may need to
           turn on promiscious mode on the interface (with -p).  With  this
           switch  you can find out what IP-address a host has without tak-
           ing an IP-address yourself.
    -t MAC Set target MAC address to use when pinging IP address.
    -T IP  Use -T as target address when pinging MACs that won't respond to
           a broadcast ping but perhaps to a directed broadcast.
           Example:
           To check the address of MAC-A, use knowledge of MAC-B and  IP-B.
           $ arping -S <IP-B> -s <MAC-B> -p <MAC-A>
    -p     Turn  on  promiscious  mode  on interface, use this if you don't
           "own" the MAC address you are using.
    -P     Send ARP replies instead of requests. Useful with -U.
    -u     Show index=received/sent instead  of  just  index=received  when
           pinging MACs.
    -U     Send unsolicited ARP.
    -v     Verbose output. Use twice for more messages.
    -V num 802.1Q tag to add. Defaults to no VLAN tag.
    -w sec Specify a timeout before ping exits regardless of how many
packets have been sent or received.
    -W sec Time to wait between pings.
