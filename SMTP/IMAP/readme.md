# IMAP ( 143,993 )
	
  The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.IMAP is defined by RFC 3501.
  IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL/TLS (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993.When you read an email message using IMAP, you aren't actually downloading or storing it on your computer; instead, you are reading it off of the server. As a result, it's possible to check your email from several different devices without missing a thing.
  
### Default IMAP port	
  	
By default, the IMAP protocol works on two ports:
  
##### 1. Port 143 - this is the default IMAP non-encrypted port
##### 2. Port 993 - this is the port you need to use if you want to connect using IMAP securely.
  
### Identifying IMAP
  	
    nmap -v -p 143 $ip
  
###### PORT    	STATE 	SERVICE

143/tcp 	open  	imap   
	
-v : verbosity level 

-p : Only scan specified ports 
 	
#### Banner grabbing
	
     nc -nv $ip 143
````
 openssl s_client -connect $ip:993 
````	

#### IMAP Version Scannig
   
      nmap -v -sV -p 143 $ip
	
-v : Increase verbosity level (use -vv or more for greater effect)
	
-sV : Probe open ports to determine service/version info
	
-p : Only scan specific ports
	
### Scripts to enumerate IMAP

     nmap -v -sC -p 143,993 --script imap-capabilities,imap-ntlm-info $ip
	
**Connection**
	
     telnet $ip 143 
	
### IMAP Command
     Command                                           Description
  
      APPEND                                          Appends the literal argument as a new message to the end of the specified destination mailbox.			
																			
      AUTHENTICATE                           Indicates a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication mechanism to the server. 					
																				
      CAPABILITY                                 Requests a listing of capabilities that the server supports.			
	
      CHECK                                           Requests a checkpoint of the currently selected mailbox.				
	
       CLOSE                                           Permanently removes all messages that have the \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox, and returns to the authenticated state from the selected state.													
										
       COPY/UID COPY                         Copies the specified message(s) to the end of the specified destination mailbox.		
											
       CREATE                                        Creates a mailbox with the given name.										
	
        DELETE                                       Permanently removes the mailbox with the given name.				
	
         UID                                              Unique identifier.																			
	
         LIST                                             Returns a subset of names from the complete set of all names available to the client.				
										
         LOGIN                                         Identifies the client to the server and carries the plaintext password authenticating this user.		
	
         LOGOUT                                     Informs the server that the client is done with the connection	
	
          RENAME                                   Changes the name of a mailbox.
	
          SEARCH                                    Searches the mailbox for messages that match the given searching criteria.
	
          SELECT                                     Selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be accessed.
	
          STORE                                       Alters data associated with a message in the mailbox.
	
          SUBSCRIBE                               Adds the specified mailbox name to the server’s set of “active” or “subscribed” mailboxes as returned by the LSUB command.
	
          UNSUBSCRIBE                        Removes the specified mailbox name from the server’s set of “active” or “subscribed” mailboxes as returned by the LSUB command.
	
          EXAMINE                                  Identical to SELECT and returns the same output; however, the selected mailbox is identified as read-only.
	
          EXPUNGE                                 Permanently removes all messages that have the \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox.
	
          LSUB                                         Returns a subset of names from the set of names that the user has declared as being “active”or "subscribed”.

          NOOP                                        Does nothing. It always succeeds.

### Curl

Curl is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). curl is powered by Libcurl. This tool is preferred for automation, since it is designed to work without user interaction. curl can transfer multiple file at once.
	
##### 1. Listing mailboxes
	
      curl -k 'imaps://$ip/' --user user:pass
	
##### 2. Listing messages in a mailbox to searching for drafts with password in mail body
	
      curl -k 'imaps://$ip/Drafts?TEXT password' --user user:pass

##### 3. Downloading a message with UID
	
      curl -k 'imaps://$ip/INBOX;UID=1' --user user:pass

-k : Allow insecure server connections when using SSL
