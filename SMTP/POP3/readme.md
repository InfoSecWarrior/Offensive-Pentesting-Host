# POP3 (Port 110, PORT 995)
  
  The POP (Post Office Protocol) provides access via an Internet Protocol (IP) network for a user client application to a mailbox (maildrop) maintained on a mail server. The protocol supports download and delete operations for messages. POP3 clients connect, retrieve all messages, store them on the client computer, and finally delete them from the server.
	There are 3 versions of POP, but POP3 is the most used.
		
**Default POP port**	

Port 110  –     Default POP3 port. 

Port 995  –     POP3 port used for SSL/TLS.

**POP3 Version Detection with Metasploit**

The pop3_version module, as its name implies, scans a host or range of hosts for POP3 mail servers and determines the version running on them.

    use auxiliary/scanner/pop3/pop3_version
    
    set RHOSTS $ip
    
    set THREADS 20
    
    run
